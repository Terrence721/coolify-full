# Architecture Overview

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->
**Last Updated: July 13, 2026**

This document explains how this repository is actually put together — verified against the real folder structure, config files, and code, not a generic description of what a Coolify-like app "usually" looks like.

Everything described here runs on **Linux end-to-end**: the development environment is Ubuntu (via WSL2 on a Windows host), every service is a Linux container on a Linux filesystem, and the whole stack behaves identically on a native Linux machine.

For the frontend migration specifically (Livewire → Inertia.js/React), see [livewire-to-react-migration.md](livewire-to-react-migration.md) — that document is the detailed, phase-by-phase source of truth for anything frontend-related and is not repeated here.

## 1. What this is

Coolify is a self-hostable PaaS: a Laravel application that manages servers, applications, databases, and services by connecting to them over SSH — there is no separate remote "agent" service running as part of this codebase. The one exception is **Sentinel**, a small metrics-collection binary Coolify installs on managed servers (via `CheckAndStartSentinelJob`) so the dashboard can show CPU/memory/disk graphs without polling over SSH for every metric; it's an installed artifact on the remote host, not a folder in this repo.

## 2. Repository structure

Verified against the actual top-level layout:

```

There is no `agents/` directory and no separate agent codebase in this repository.

## 3. Backend (`app/`)

- **`Actions/`** — domain actions using `lorisleiva/laravel-actions`, organized by area: `Application/`, `Database/`, `Docker/`, `Proxy/`, `Server/`, `Service/`, `Shared/`, `CoolifyTask/`, `Fortify/`, `User/`. `CoolifyTask/RunRemoteProcess.php` is the action that actually runs commands on remote servers over SSH (via the `instant_remote_process()` / `SshMultiplexingHelper` helpers in `bootstrap/helpers/remoteProcess.php`) — this is the real "remote execution" layer, not a separate agent process. There is no `Stripe/` subfolder — this fork removed the Stripe/subscription billing subsystem entirely (see [todo.md](../todo.md)).
- **`Http/Controllers/`** — REST API controllers (`Api/`) plus the growing set of Inertia page controllers created during the React migration (see the migration doc).
- **`Livewire/`** — the UI layer for pages not yet migrated to Inertia/React. As of the latest phase, more full-page components have been converted to Inertia/React than remain on Livewire — see [livewire-to-react-migration.md](livewire-to-react-migration.md) for the exact running count.
- **`Models/`** — Eloquent models (`Server`, `Application`, `Service`, `Project`, `Team`, standalone database models, etc.).
- **`Jobs/`** — queued work: deployments (`ApplicationDeploymentJob`), backups, Docker cleanup, and periodic checks like `CheckAndStartSentinelJob`, `CheckForUpdatesJob`. Runs on Redis-backed queues via Horizon.
- **`Services/`** — orchestration/business logic (`ConfigurationGenerator`, `DockerImageParser`, `ContainerStatusAggregator`, `HetznerService`, etc.).
- **`Policies/`** — authorization, registered in `AuthServiceProvider`.

## 4. Frontend (`resources/`)

```text
resources/
├── css/
├── fonts/
├── js/
│   ├── Layouts/     # React persistent layouts (Inertia)
│   ├── Pages/       # React page components (Inertia), path mirrors the converted Livewire namespace
│   ├── app.js       # Livewire/Alpine entrypoint
│   └── inertia-app.jsx  # Inertia/React entrypoint
└── views/           # Blade templates — both Livewire component views and the Inertia root view
```

Two frontend stacks coexist in the same app during the migration:

- **Livewire 3 + Alpine.js + Blade** — the remaining not-yet-converted pages, now the minority.
- **Inertia.js + React 19** — the majority of full-page components at this point in the migration; see [livewire-to-react-migration.md](livewire-to-react-migration.md) for the exact running count, the reasoning for choosing Inertia over a plain SPA + API (the short version: Inertia was chosen specifically so we *don't* have to build and version a separate REST API for a full SPA), and the conversion recipe used for each page.

Tailwind CSS v4, Monaco Editor (code editor), and XTerm.js (terminal) round out the frontend dependencies — see [TECH_STACK.md](../TECH_STACK.md) for the full list.

## 5. Deployment flow

A deployment does not go through a separate agent service — it's a Laravel job that SSHes into the target server directly:

1. A deployment is triggered (push webhook, manual redeploy, or scheduled).
2. `ApplicationDeploymentJob` is queued (Redis + Horizon).
3. The job builds and runs shell commands on the target server via `instant_remote_process()` (SSH, with connection multiplexing to avoid re-authenticating per command).
4. Container/build status updates are broadcast over Soketi (WebSockets) so Livewire/Inertia pages update in real time via `ApplicationStatusChanged`/`ServiceStatusChanged`/`ProxyStatusChanged` events.
5. Server-side metrics (CPU/memory/disk) come from the optional Sentinel binary installed on the remote server, polled/displayed via `Server\Sentinel\*`.

## 6. Docker & environments

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Base/production service definitions |
| `docker-compose.dev.yml` | Local development override — adds `postgres`, `redis`, `soketi`, `vite`, `testing-host`, `mailpit`, `minio` alongside the `coolify` app container |
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | Production-specific overrides |
| `docker-compose.windows.yml` | Windows Docker Desktop-specific overrides |
| `docker/` | Dockerfiles for the `coolify-helper` and `coolify-realtime` images, plus dev/prod/testing-host variants |

The database is **PostgreSQL** (`config/database.php` defaults `DB_CONNECTION` to `pgsql`), not MySQL. Redis backs caching, queues, and Horizon. Soketi is the WebSocket server for real-time broadcasting.

See [DEVELOPING_IN_CONTAINERS_WINDOWS.md](../DEVELOPING_IN_CONTAINERS_WINDOWS.md) for the actual day-to-day local dev workflow used on this machine.

## 7. CI

- **`.circleci/config.yml`** — CircleCI pipeline.
- **`.github/workflows/quality.yml`** — GitHub Actions (formatting/static analysis/tests).
